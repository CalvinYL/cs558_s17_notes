# Presentation: Swift Attack
1. Swift is an international organization that allows secure banking transactions through a messaging service
2. An unknown organization attempted to steal 951 million with 81 million actually being stolen
3. 3 additional attacks were detected in June 2016
4. Swift setup 16 mandatory security measures for partnership banks such that if they failed to pass a measure they would not be allowed to conduct buisness using swift.

## Attack Strategy
## How Swift works
1. A local bank would contact a national bank to conduct a transaction.
2. The national bank would create a swift message, send it the oversea's bank who would verify the message.
3. The oversea's bank would send a swift acknowledgment back to the national bank.
4. The national bank would queue the swift message in a queue until processing time
5. The transaction would then go through and the funds would transfer to the recipient bank

## The attack
1. A malware/ modified dll file was installed in the oversea's bank computer
2. This would make it so the swift message would always be authenticated and go to the swift aliance database ( which sends it to the queue)
3. The attacker would then directly send the message to the swift aliance database, thus bypassing any message authentication or human checking, as it would not send a return message to the bank.
4. The message would be sent to the queue and processed.

They speculate this was possible due to old hardware and old software that needed security patches, this attack was only found due to a typo spotted by a swift operator who looked at the transaction. To this day the 81 million has not been found.

They speculate that the malware is traced back to the group: Lazarus.

# CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)

 1. Created in 1982-1983
 2. The movie "wargames" helped bring about the creation of the CFAA
 3. Roots of the CFAA (1970's)
 4.  Theft Crimes: taking/using data that is not one's own property including copying said data
	- Fraud Crime: impersonating as someone else in order to gain access to data
	- Trespass crimes: accessing data sets or data that one does not have permission to access.
 5. CFAA today (simplified and main points):
	 - one cannot obtain info/data related to the creation of nuclear weapons or information that would harm the US
	 - one cannot obtain info/data that one does not have access to
	 - one cannot commit fraud with computers
	 - one cannot cause damage to a computer one does not have permission to access

### Legal Jargon:

 - Intentionally: Outcome is why your doing it
 - Knowingly: You are aware that this will be your outcome
 - Recklessly: Disregarding the risks/consequences of your actions
 - Negligence: A reasonable person will know this action will occur as a result
 - Strict Liability: No matter the intent, you are liable and held responsible for your actions 
 - Protected Computer: 
	 - Computer: smartphone, smatwatch, smartTV, etc, but not a hand-held calculator among other things
	 - Protected: exclusive rights and use by the US for affecting foreign commerce and communication
 - Damage: impairment to the integrity of availability of data   
 - Loss: monetary/non-monetary value loss
 
However the CFAA is still relatively new, and many, many cases still fall within a gray area that would need to be dealt with on a per-trial basis.
