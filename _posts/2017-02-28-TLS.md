# TLS
* Most popular encryption protocol
* Encrypts from a client (browser) to a server (such as a Facebook server in the example below)
* HTTPS uses TLS
* Where can backdoors happen?

In browsers:
* Root store of trusted public keys
* For example, geotrust
* Comes baked into browser
* For the most part not tampered with (Avast does though)

## How TLS works:

Website doesn't know who you are
But we know who the certificate authorities are
When connecting to a server, establish session key, which we can use to do symmetric crypto
We use a key exchange protocol called Key Establishment = TLS Handshake

### TLS Handshake/Key Establishment
Start by knowing public key of geotrust <- cert authority
Set up session key k

Must negotiate what cipher to use.
Server has PK<sub>f</sub>, SK<sub>f</sub>

Client Hello sends:
* Ciphersuites it can use
* client random (cr)
Server Hello sends:
* Returns lots of stuff
* Cipher suite it wants to use
* Server random (sr)
* Random a
* Computes g^a with generator g
* Also sends generator g
* and signature
	
If client and server agree that they want to speak DH (Diffehelman)
* Group G generator g
* Easy to find g^x given g and x
* Hard to find x such that g^x = y given g and y

Client needs to know PK<sub>f</sub> but can't just get it from server, in this case Facebook
Also don't want geotrust's public key
Facebook must use SK<sub>f</sub> to Sign<sub>SK<sub>f</sub></sub>(g, g^a, cr, sr)
Also sends certificate (PK<sub>f</sub>, Facebook, issuer:geotrust)

What does Certificate look like? (cert1):
* Cert(PK<sub>f</sub>, Facebook, issuer:geotrust)
* Subject: Facebook
* Public key: PK<sub>f</sub>
* Issuer: geotrust
* Above 3 (cert1) are signed with geotrust's secret key SK<sub>geotrust</sub>: Sign<sub>SK<sub>geotrust-short</sub></sub>(cert1)

cert2:
* Subject: geotrust shorterm key
* PK: PK<sub>geotrust-short</sub>
* Issue: geotrust
* Sign<sub>SK<sub>geotrust</sub></sub>(cert2)
	
Now client must verify signature from Facebook:
* Uses PK<sub>f</sub> pulled out of cert1, and checks if it corresponds with cr and sr
* Verifies signature of cert1, using cert2's PK<sub>geotrust-short</sub>
* Verify cert2 using root store in browser
* Browser cuts you off if not secure

#### Must now get session key
Client chooses random b
Computes g^b
Sends to server

Client grabs g^a, computes g^{ab} (Secret number only known to alice and bob)
Server grabs g^b and raises it to the a to compute g^{ab}
One sided because client doesn't have a certificate, only servers do

Computes tuple with ms, key1, key2 using PRF:
* ms = master secret
* (ms, k1, k2) = PRF<sub>g^{ab}</sub>(cr||sr)
* The PRF is defined in the cipher suite

You MAC transcript1 and 2 to make sure all previous steps were seen by client and server:	
Client MAC<sub>ms</sub>(transcript1)
* Transcript1 = all previous steps as seen by client
Server: MAC<sub>ms</sub>(transcript2)
* Transcript2 = all previous steps as seen by server
Server verifies client MAC with ms generated from the PRF with g^{ab} and (cr,sr)

If the MACs check out, client uses session key k1 to encrypt, k2 to decrypt, and server uses session key k2 to encrypt, k1 to decrypt
* Authenc<sub>k1</sub>(message)
* Authens<sub>k2</sub>(message)
	
Keys are very short lived (deleted after communication)
Makes it very hard to decrypt all these newly generated keys
*Forward secrecy* because even if you steal secret key of Facebook, still can't decrypt past messages. You could forge signatures for all future communications, but can't decrypt past communications.

### Clipper chip protocol
Session key: k1
Golden key: k*
c = Enc<sub>k1</sub>(m)
Dec<sub>k1</sub>(c) = m
Dec<sub>k*</sub>(c) = m
Could therefore decrypt all past communication
Would be terrible for security world-wide!!!	

### Other backdoors of TLS
Consider threat of SK<sub>f</sub> being compromised 
* Can not decrypt past communications (forward secrecy)
* Impersonate FB in future communications
If SK<sub>geotrust</sub> was stolen
* You could impersonate anyone
* Still have forward secrecy though
